# Games-Full

This games website is designed to archive a list of games for myself and my friends. It uses google authenticate for easy login information, or allows you to create a personalized user profile with your own username, password, and choice of email. Once logged in, you can view the list of all games, and clicking on each one will show you information about the game, such as name, release date, developer, and a description of the game. Then users can leave a review of their experience with the game. A user may only delete or edit their own posts, and there is a home page to show each individual post. 

# Installation 
To install this program, clone the repository from https://github.com/parkermax93/games-full, then run 'bundle install' in the terminal.

# Usage 
The user must first create a signup profile that includes a unique email, username, and password. From the signup page, the user wil be automatically be routed to the game index. Once an account is created, they can go to the sign in side instead. From the index page, the user will see all games listed by all users. They will also be able to add a new game to the database from the index page which can only be edited or deleted by the original user who added it to the database. Once a user selects an individual game, they will then be able to read all reviews listed as well as edit or delete reviews that they have posted.
